In the fifth grade, my teacher used to give homework; `to make booklets on given topics`. In the beginning, mine was nothing but mediocre. However, the more I worked on, the more I got fascinated by the process of explaining my understanding of a variety of topics. Especially, I was shy and not so much of a conversationalist back then, I realized visual aids significantly enhanced my communication skills.

When I again made a career transition to the IT sector two years ago, I realized sometimes I spoke a different language with some colleagues with engineering backgrounds. Whenever that happened, we drew our rough ideas and thoughts which I enjoyed so much. 

Let me share some of my works in the following areas: 

- Illustrator
- Data Visualization
- Web Design(e.g. CSS, UX/UI)
