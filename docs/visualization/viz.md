In the fifth grade, my teacher used to give homework; `to make booklets on given topics`. In the beginning, mine was nothing but mediocre. However, the more I worked on, the more I got fascinated by the process of explaining my understanding of a variety of topics. Especially, I was shy and not so much of a conversationalist back then, I realized visual aids significantly enhanced my communication skills.

When I again made a career transition to the IT sector two years ago, I realized sometimes I spoke a different language with some colleagues with engineering backgrounds. Whenever that happened, we drew our rough ideas and thoughts which I enjoyed so much. 

Let me share some of my works in the following areas: 

- Illustrator
- Data Visualization
- Web Design(e.g. CSS, UX/UI)

## Illustrator
### Favicon for this blog
I found a nice Jekyll them, Just the Docs! It seems very ideal for archiving my daily life and learning. As much as I love the theme, I also wanted to customize it so that `it feels more like my own space`. I decided to design a tiny little favicon.ico! Here comes my flow of thoughts :)

- Useful Tips
- [x] <span style="color:#7253ed">`Join tools`</span> &nbsp; work like a charm when combining paths seamlessly.
- [x] <span style="color:#7253ed"> `contrl+2`</span>: &nbsp; lock an object 
- [x] <span style="color:#7253ed"> `option+contrl+2`</span>: &nbsp; unlock all objects 
- [x] <span style="color:#7253ed"> `command+b` </span>: &nbsp; paste behind the copied graphic.

<span stype="font-size:small">To imitate neon lights, differentially blurred objects have to be merged. Most important thing is that the objects have to be merged orderly; we have to bring less blurred object forward and send more blurred one backward. `command+b` pasted a copied object behind the original one, which makes the orderly arrangement of objects easier.</span> 

- [x] <span style="color:#7253ed"> `favicon.ico` </span>: &nbsp; you can simply convert png to ico by changing a file name (Mac)
