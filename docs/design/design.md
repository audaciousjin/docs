In the fifth grade, my teacher used to give unique homework; `to make booklets on given topics`. In the beginning, mine was nothing but mediocre. However, the more I worked on, the more I got fascinated by the process of digesting a certain subject and explaining it my own way. Especially, I was shy and not so much of a conversationalist back then, I realized visual aids significantly enhanced my communication skills.

When I made a career transition to a science and technology research institute two years ago, I realized sometimes I spoke a different language with some colleagues with engineering backgrounds. Whenever that happened, we drew our rough ideas and thoughts which I enjoyed so much. 

Let me share some of my works in the following areas: 

- Illustrator
- Data Visualization
- Web Design(e.g. CSS, UX/UI)

## Illustrator
### Favicon for this blog 
{: .d-inline-block }

New 
{: .label .label-green }

I found a nice Jekyll them, Just the Docs! It seems very ideal for archiving my daily life and learning. As much as I love the theme, I also wanted to customize it so that `it feels more like my own space`. I decided to design a tiny little favicon.ico! Here comes my flow of thoughts :)

- <strong>Tips for Illustrator</strong> 
    1. <span style="color:#7253ed">Join</span> &nbsp; work like a charm when combining paths seamlessly (ol)
    1. <span style="color:#7253ed">command+2</span>: &nbsp; lock an object (ol)
    1. <span style="color:#7253ed">option+contrl+2</span>: &nbsp; unlock all objects (ol)
    1. <span style="color:#7253ed">command+b</span>: &nbsp; paste behind the copied graphic. (ol)
   1. <span style="color:#7253ed">*.ico</span>: &nbsp; you can simply convert png to ico by changing a file name/extension (Mac) (ol)
    
  When to use paste behind? To imitate neon lights, differentially blurred objects have to be merged. Most important thing is that the objects have to be merged orderly; we have to bring less blurred object forward and send more blurred one backward. `command+b` pasted a copied object behind the original one, which makes the orderly arrangement of objects easier.
    

- <strong>Tips for Jekyll & Github Pages</strong>  
    1. <span style="color:#7253ed">Custom domain</span> &nbsp; CNAME file must include "www." to avoid redirected loop errors (ol)
    1. <span style="color:#7253ed">PATH</span> &nbsp; when an image doesn't show up or CSS fails to load, check out PATHs (ol)
    1. <span style="color:#7253ed"> command+shift+r </span> &nbsp; deleted cached data in a Chrome browser

### Research areas of previous workplace
When I started my new internship at a research institue, I visualized our research team's topics for fun :) I still consider myself as a novice Illustrator design. They're my works using Illustrator. Although technically everything moment was challenge, I really enjoyed the entire process.
